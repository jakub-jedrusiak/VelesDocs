    "text": "Veles is a Python library, so before using it, you need to install Python. You can download an installation bundle from the official website. During installation, check the box saying to add Python to PATH. It will enable you to run Python by writing python in the terminal, without the full path to python.exe. If you’re using Linux or MacOS, you already have Python installed by default.\nUsing an IDE is recommended. You can use any IDE, but I highly recommend Visual Studio Code. If you want to use it, it’s a good idea to also download Python Extension Pack and Pylance. You can do it from within the program. You can also use RStudio if you want.\nSome really basic knowledge how to use Python is recommended. If you know what’s a variable and how to call functions, you’re good to go. If you don’t know anything about programming, this 1-hour Python introduction will be more than enough (although I think VSCode is better than PyCharm).\nTo actually build (or even preview) your survey, you must have yarn installed. It’s a JavaScript package manager and is used to download some dependencies like Survey.js and React. yarn gets installed with Node.js. If you’re a Windows user, you can download it from the official website. MacOS comes with Node.js preinstalled. If you’re a Linux user, chances are you have Node.js already installed. If so, you should be able to run this command in your terminal (PowerShell or cmd in Windows):\nnpm -v\nOtherwise you can use one of the following commands:\n# Ubuntu (and other apt distros)\nsudo apt install npm\n\n# Arch\nsudo pacman -S npm\n\n# winget\nwinget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS\n\n# Chocolatey\nchoco install nodejs-lts\n\n# Homebrew\nbrew install node\nAfter installing node.js, activate yarn with this command in the terminal:\ncorepack enable\nIf everything went well, command yarn -v should return a version number.\n\n\n\n\nyarn -v in Linux terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyarn -v in Linux terminal",

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\nIn Veles, questions are a class of objects. There are two main ways of creating them – separately or when we want to convert a whole questionnaire at once. In both cases we use an appropriate question function. See the docs\n\nradio()\nLet’s start with creating some demographic questions with vls.radio(). The syntax is as follows:\n\nvls.radio(name, title, *choices, **kwargs)\n\nTo create a single-choice question we need to invoke the vls.radio() function and fill it with appropriate data. The first thing is the name argument which is the internal code of the question that will later become the name of the column in the database. Then we have title which is the actual text of the question the participant will see. Finally we need to fill in the possible answers. We can separate them with commas. In the end we get:\n\ngender = vls.radio(\n    \"gender\",\n    \"What is your gender?\",\n    \"Woman\",\n    \"Man\",\n    \"Other/I don't want to answer\",\n)\n\n\n\n\nGender question example\n\n\nThere are two things to notice here. Firstly, I save the created question to a variable called gender. We will then use the variable to put the question in a page. Secondly, all the texts are inside quotation marks. That is required, because otherwise Python will think the words are variables.\n\n\nQuestion options\nEach question can have a series of additional parameters specified. For example we can make an answer required, add a subtitle, add an “Other” option that opens a textbox to specify a custom answer, hide the question number, specify when a question should be visible and so on.\n\ngender = vls.radio(\n    \"gender\",\n    \"What is your gender?\",\n    \"Woman\",\n    \"Man\",\n    isRequired=True,\n    showOtherItem=True,\n    showNoneItem=True,\n    noneText=\"Prefer not to say\",\n    hideNumber=True,\n    description=\"Choose an answer from options below\",\n)\n\n\n\n\nGender questions with options specified\n\n\nEvery type of question (as well as pages and surveys) has its set of possible options. To check the possible options you can consult the docs or (in VS Code with Pylance installed) you can hover your mouse over the name of a function and scroll though the popup.\n\n\n\n\nThe documentation you can see when you hover over a name of the function in VS Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documentation you can see when you hover over a name of the function in VS Code\n\n\n\n\n\nWhole questionnaires\nOften in behavioral sciences we want to use a whole questionnaire. It’s quite pointless to format every item separately, because they often have the same scale, options and predictable labels. In Veles the question() also allows to convert a whole questionnaire at once.\nTo do this, we need to have the questionnaire in the form of a Python list. We can format it either by hand, using split() method or with split arguments. In the second and third cases, we need to have our items separated by some common separator, e.g. every item in a separate line. Both methods are shown below\n\n# manually formatted list\nRSSI_items = [\n    \"I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.\",\n    \"I feel that I have a number of good qualities.\",\n    \"All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.\",\n    \"I am able to do things as well as most other people.\",\n    \"I feel I do not have much to be proud of.\",\n    \"I take a positive attitude toward myself.\",\n    \"On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.\",\n    \"I wish I could have more respect for myself.\",\n    \"I certainly feel useless at times.\",\n    \"At times I think I am no good at all.\",\n]\n\n# triple quotation for multi-line strings\nRSSI_items = \"\"\"I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.\nI feel that I have a number of good qualities.\nAll in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.\nI am able to do things as well as most other people.\nI feel I do not have much to be proud of.\nI take a positive attitude toward myself.\nOn the whole, I am satisfied with myself.\nI wish I could have more respect for myself.\nI certainly feel useless at times.\nAt times I think I am no good at all.\"\"\"\n\n# scale\nRSSI_scale = \"Strongly Agree; Agree; Disagree; Strongly Disagree\"\n\nRSSI = vls.question(\n    \"RSSI\",\n    RSSI.split(\"\\n\"),\n    RSSI_scale.split(\"; \"),\n    options=QuestionOptions(required=True),\n)\n\nThe \"\"\" allows us to write multiple line strings.\nWe save our items and answers in variables and treat them with split(). In here I’ve done it inside the question() function, but I also could have done it anywhere before that. To learn more about Python string methods, see W3Schools lesson about them. Had I used the manually formatted list, I wouldn’t have to write the split() part.\nIf question_text is a list, question() output is a list of questions. Each question in the list have the same options, scale and type. The labels will become \"RSSI_1\", \"RSSI_2\", \"RSSI_3\" etc.\n\n\nList comprehension\nThe power of Python allows us to bulk modify our questions and answers. This might be the greatest advantage Veles has over its GUI-based1 alternatives. Let’s imagine we have a list of drinks we want to ask about in our survey. Yet we don’t want the question text to be just “Tea” or “Coffee” (especially coffee) but rather something like “How do you feel about tea?”. English being fairly uncomplicated, we just need to put the drink’s name into the sentence. We can easily use a loop and an f-string to do just that.\n\nfrom velesresearch import question\n\n# get our drinks and make them a list\ndrinks = \"tea coffee juice water\".split(\" \")\n\n# modify with a loop\ndrinks = [f\"How do you like {drink}?\" for drink in drinks]\n\n# add some answers\nanswers = \"I love it; I like it; It's OK; I don't like it; I despise it\".split(\"; \")\n\n# make it a list of questions\nq_drinks = question(\"drinks\", drinks, answers)\n\nFirst we get our drinks separated with some common separator (a space in this example). We then split it and save it in a drinks variable. After that we modify it with an f-string and a for loop. An f-string is a string preceded with an f. Inside it, we can use variables’ values if we enclose them in curly braces. After the f-string we put a shorthand loop syntax (it’s called list comprehension). It will take every value inside the drinks one by one, put them in a variable called drink2 and do whatever we commanded before the for keyword. When it’s done with the first value, it saves the result and moves on to the next drink until the list ends. Notice everything is in square brackets. We then overwrite the drinks variable with the newly created list.\n\n\nQuestionnaire library\nVeles has it’s own (currently small) questionnaire library. Thanks to it, you can quickly add a whole questionnaire with only one command. The library is available in the veleslibrary package. To use it, you need to install and import it first.\n# In the terminal\npip install veleslibrary\n\nfrom veleslibrary.questionnaires import rse\n\nsurvey(\"self_esteem_survey\", page(\"RSE\", rse()))  # Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale\n\nLibrary is multilingual.\n\nfrom veleslibrary.questionnaires.pl import tipi\n\nsurvey(\"personality\", page(\"TIPI\", tipi()))  # TIPI in Polish\n\nGo here to read more about the library. Feel free to contribute to the library by adding your own questionnaires. More information here.",

    "text": "Self-hosting\nIf we want to manage our surveys ourselves, we need a place to host them and a place to store the results. Luckily there are free methods to do both. In here we’ll use Vercel for hosting and MongoDB Atlas for storing the results. Additional benefit of self-hosting is that we can use our own domain name e.g. create a special subdomain in our university’s domain (like surveys.uwr.edu.pl). That is if someone will give us access to the DNS settings.\n\nConfiguration\n\nGo to VelesSurvey for Vercel GitHub repository. Click on “Use this template” button. Give your repo a name and confirm with “Create repository from template” button. Of course you need to be logged into your GitHub account.\nGo to Vercel, create an account and from there start a new project. Link the project to your newly created GitHub repo.\nDon’t change the default deployment settings but do click on Enviroment variables. Add a new variable named SECRET_KEY with a value generated with this website and confirm with “Add” button. If you plan to use a custom domain, you can also add a DOMAIN_NAME variable with a value like .uwr.edu.pl to match all subdomains of uwr.edu.pl. Don’t worry, if you don’t know yet. You can always add it later. You can read more about custom domains here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the building process ends, you can visit your page. It’s just a white screen with a moving Veles logo. By design, there’s no survey list on the main page. It helps keeping everything confidential.\nNot only we need a place to collect our responses, but also somewhere to store them. For this purpuse we’ll use MongoDB and its free 512 MB of space. My rough calculations say it will allow us to collect around 1 600 000 responses before the space runs out. I wish everyone this kind of probe sizes. Go to MongoDB, create a free account and then a free cluster. The website will take you through the whole process.\nNow we need do connect Vercel and MongoDB. You can do it on this website. Click “Add integration” and go with the forms. It will make some needed security changes to your MongoDB cluster, so the answers can be sent from Vercel app to the database.\nThat’s it. Test your application by going to /tea_survey in your Vercel app (e.g. https://tea-research-project.vercel.app/tea_survey/). You should see a survey with a series of questions about tea. When you complete it, you should see a new response in your database.\n\n\n\nUsing\nWhen you create a survey with Veles, you get a folder with a series of files. The most important one is main.js from build subfolder. To add it to your site, you need to create a new subfolder in the surveys folder in your repository. The easiest way to do it it through GitHub Desktop. Use it to download (or “clone”) your repository and create a new folder inside the surveys folder. The name of that folder will become a link to your survey, e.g. if you name it black_tea_study, the link will be something like https://tea-research-project.vercel.app/black_tea_study. Then put your main.js in your newly created folder. Do not rename it. Then use GitHub Desktop to upload (or “push”) your changes. After a minute or so, your survey should be available.\nTo read and save your data you can use web desktop on mongodb.com or with a special program called MongoDB Compass. After any responses are recieved (even for the tea survey), a new database called VelesResponses is created. Every survey gets its own folder (or “collection”). From there you can easily export your data to .csv or .json.\nIf you use R for analysis, you can connect to the database directly, without having to download anything. See this article for the details. You can also do that with Python.",
